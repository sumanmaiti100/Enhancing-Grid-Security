# Enhancing-Grid-Security

This repository contains grid models related to the work submitted to ACM CCS 2025. Each folder includes different attack models and defender models. The grid models are compatible with MATLAB SIMULINK R2021a or later versions. To simulate the models, load the .mat files into the MATLAB workspace, then open the corresponding .slx model to run the attack and defense simulations.
